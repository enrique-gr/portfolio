                Starting Point
            </h2>
            <p>
                I grew up liking anything that made me curious about how things worked. Over time, I learned that I enjoy working on real problems, not just ideas. I like having something in front of me that I can break down, understand, and improve.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 2 -->
        <section class="mb-12 space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            <h2 class="text-xs font-mono uppercase text-gray-500 tracking-widest mb-2">
                What Matters To Me
            </h2>
            <p>
                I care about staying focused, being reliable, and giving full effort even when progress is slow. I like work that rewards patience, honesty, and consistency. I do not rush the process. I would rather build something carefully than chase quick results.
            </p>
            <p>
                I respect people who stay calm when things get difficult and who can think clearly when problems start stacking up. That mindset is something I try to practice in my own work and outside of it.
            </p>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->
        <section class="mb-12 space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            <h2 class="text-xs font-mono uppercase text-gray-500 tracking-widest mb-2">
                How I Approach Challenges
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I run into a wall, I step back, break the problem into smaller parts, and move forward one step at a time. I do not expect instant answers. Most progress comes from showing up, paying attention, and not quitting when it gets uncomfortable.

        <section class="mb-12 space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            <h2 class="text-xs font-mono uppercase text-gray-500 tracking-widest mb-2">
                What I’m Working Toward
            </h2>
            <p>
                I want to keep growing into someone who earns trust through actions, not words. I want more responsibility, tougher problems, and the chance to contribute to work that actually matters. I am not in a hurry. I just want to keep moving forward with purpose.
            </p>

        <!-- SECTION 5 -->
        <section class="space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            <h2 class="text-xs font-mono uppercase text-gray-500 tracking-widest mb-2">
                Outside the Work
            </h2>
            <p>
                I like training, learning new skills, and working on myself with the same steady effort I bring to engineering. I enjoy quiet routines, clear goals, and the feeling of earning progress rather than expecting it.
